# EXPLANATION
# Introduction to MBTI

The MBTI assessment is used by organizations and individuals around the world to improve their interactions and to promote effectiveness in their work and personal lives. Organizations use it to improve communication, teamwork, and leadership. People in relationships of all kinds use it to better understand one another, to enhance communication, and to reduce conflict, resulting in more positive and productive interactions.
## Background on the MBTI

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment was developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Cook Briggs, who spent years observing people. They created the assessment based on the personality type theory proposed by psychologist Carl Jung. Their goal was to help people understand how natural, healthy differences in the way people take in information and come to conclusions lead so clearly to the different ways people act and react, make life choices, relate to others, and make sense of the world. These insights help explain why different people are interested in different things, prefer various kinds of work, and sometimes find it hard to understand each other.
## Myers & Briggs' Personality Theory

The Myers-Briggs system describes a person’s personality through four opposing personality functions, variously known as dichotomies, preferences or scales.    

    1. Extraversion vs. Introversion: How do you gain energy? Extraverts like to be with others and gain energy from people and the environment. Introverts gain energy from alone-time and need periods of quiet reflection throughout the day.

    2. Sensing vs. Intuition: How do you collect information? Sensors gather facts from their immediate environment and rely on the things they can see, feel and hear. Intuitives look more at the overall context and think about patterns, meaning, and connections.

    3. Thinking vs. Feeling: How do you make decisions? Thinkers look for the logically correct solution, whereas Feelers make decisions based on their emotions, values, and the needs of others.  
    
    4. Judging vs. Perceiving: How do you organize your environment? Judgers prefer structure and like things to be clearly regulated, whereas Perceivers like things to be open and flexible and are reluctant to commit themselves.

The choice of preference in Myers and Briggs' system, is either you’re an Introvert or an Extrovert,OR a Judger or a Perceiver.
### Personality types and its Behaviours

Myers and Briggs outlined 16 personality types based on the four personality preferences. Each personality type is designated with a four-letter code, with each letter signifying one of the personality preferences.  

Isabel Briggs Myers stressed that each personality type was more than the sum of its parts, and her descriptions of each type were intended to explain how all four of the personality preferences came together to interact, synergize, and form a cohesive type. This gives Myers and Briggs' personality type descriptions the advantage of showing us how to conceptualize various combinations of personality traits—for instance, the difference between someone who is extraverted, kind and compassionate, and a similarly extraverted person who is more logical and emotionally detached. Other personality systems, such as the Big Five, typically talk about personality traits in isolation, which is often less helpful when trying to conceptualize a person as a whole.

## Abstract

In this project , our focus revolves around the nuanced analysis of individuals' social media posts, with the primary objective of discerning their personality types according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework, encompassing the 16 distinct personality types. The foundational phase of this project involves meticulous scrutiny of raw data, followed by a sophisticated data processing stage aimed at extracting salient features pivotal for subsequent evaluations.    

Upon completion of the data processing phase, a judicious split is applied, allocating 60% of the data for the model training process and reserving the remaining portion for rigorous testing. To bolster the predictive prowess of our models, an array of algorithms, including but not limited to XG Boost, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, have been strategically employed.

Despite our comprehensive approach, the initial assessment of model accuracies has revealed a need for refinement. The empirical results indicate that the attained accuracies fall short of the desired benchmarks. This acknowledgment propels us into a phase of introspection and improvement.

## Further Improvisation

In response to the initial outcome, a strategic refinement was introduced by condensing the approach from considering all 16 personality types to focusing on four classifiers aligned with the MBTI axes. This recalibration aimed at enhancing the precision of our predictive models.

The revised methodology commenced with a meticulous reanalysis of the dataset, followed by the implementation of advanced data preprocessing techniques, including lemmatization. This discerning process served to eliminate extraneous elements, ensuring a more refined and relevant dataset. Subsequently, feature extraction was conducted from the processed data, aligning with the targeted classifiers.

In adherence to best practices, the dataset was partitioned into distinct training (60%) and testing sets. This dichotomy facilitated an effective evaluation of model performance. Leveraging a comprehensive suite of algorithms such as XG Boost, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-NN, and others, the models underwent rigorous training.

The culmination of this endeavour yielded a notable enhancement in the accuracies achieved by the respective algorithms. This positive shift in performance metrics underscores the efficacy of the refined approach. The discernible increase in accuracies signifies a significant stride towards achieving the project's overarching goal of robust and accurate personality prediction based on social media data.

This iterative process of analysis, refinement, and performance evaluation reflects our commitment to excellence and the pursuit of optimal outcomes in the dynamic landscape of personality prediction through advanced data analytics.
